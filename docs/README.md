Here at Unlocked, we're aiming to build a component library to help you build the future. 

This documentation covers implementation details for individual components as well as how to use Unlocked as a foundation to build out your design system. You can also [check out Unlocked's storybook]('https://storybook.unlocked.to').

## How to contribute

Unlocked hopes to become a self-sustaining community of developers and designers. If you wish to become a maintainer, check out our [contribution guide]('/community/contribution-guide').

## Raising an issue

We're looking at ways to make sure this process is as smooth as possible.

For now, please raise issues on our GitHub repository and ensure that the issue conforms to our [issue report format]('/community/bug-report'). Issues that don't conform to this will be closed to help smooth out our development processes.
