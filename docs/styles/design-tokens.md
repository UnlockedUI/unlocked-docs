# Design tokens

Unlocked uses it's own formatted set of colour classes, replicating standardised naming conventions to help lay the foundations for your design system.

### Colour classes
```js
{
  'primary': '#00000',
  'secondary': '#00000',
  'text': '#00000'
  'textDark': '#00000'
  'background': '#00000'
  'backgroundDark': '#00000'
}
```

 ::: warning You can of course work around this if you need to by creating your own theme. However, this wasn't the intended workaround and it will take a significant amount of time.

## Exporting from Figma

If you're utilising our Figma UI kit, we have structured the file in order for it to be design token friendly.

::: tip 
We recommend you use the [Design Tokens](https://github.com) plugin for Figma as this is the tool we used when initially structuring the file.
